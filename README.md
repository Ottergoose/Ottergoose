# Hi Everybody!

[I'm Nick Benson, an aviation geek, train buff, and photography nerd from Burnsville, MN](https://ottergoose.net).

I'm not doing a super great job at collaborating at the moment, but have helped out on a handful of projects, especially with respect to open source flight tracking.

## Currently spending time working on
- [JetTip](https://jettip.net), a commercial alert service for aviation enthusiasts
- [MilAir.Tips](https://milair.tips), an experimental ~~Twitterbot~~ (Mastodon, eventuaully, maybe?) network tracking military aircraft
- [Railfan Atlas](https://railfanatlas.com), a railroad photography Flickr / Google Maps mashup

## Providing financial support to
- [ADSB.lol](https://www.adsb.lol/), an open source flight tracker that aggergates and shares flight data freely
- [ADSB.im]([https://adsb.im/), an easy to use, open source interface for collecting and sharing flight data
