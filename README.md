# Hi Everybody!

[I'm Nick Benson, a web developer, photographer, aviation geek, and train buff from Burnsville, MN](https://ottergoose.net).

I'm not doing a super great job at collaborating at the moment, but have helped out on a handful of projects, especially for ExpressionEngine, Craft CMS, and open source flight tracking.

## Currently spending time working on...
- [JetTip](https://jettip.net), a commercial alert service for aviation enthusiasts
- [MilAir.Tips](https://milair.tips), an experimental Twitterbot network tracking military aircraft
- [Railfan Atlas](https://railfanatlas.com), a railroad photography Flickr / Google Maps mashup
